(WORK IN PROGRESS)  

In this section we can describe options for creating a RestAPI application from scratch or that wraps an existing function. Make references to existing samples as appropriate

Show how a product team could create there own product specific profile for Cli
Should we have a zowe profile for cli?.


In this tutorial we consider how an organisation with a product existing or under development with no pre-existing Rest API can be Onboarded to Zowe. This would then allow the product to be available from a central location and benefit from other Zowe API Mediation layer functionality. 

At this stage of your development you have more options and can design with Zowe in mind. 

As the example product we are using a simple Spring Boot sample app that can be downloaded here: [spring-boot-jzos-sample](https://github.com/zowe/spring-boot-jzos-sample)
